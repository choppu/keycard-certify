# Keycard Certify

To create certificates you should first fill in the form, specifying lot number, the quantity of cards for which you need to create a certificate, destination path for the certificates file and choose the output encryption PGP key. You also need a Keycard to sign the certificates. Path `m/43'/60'/1581'/2'/0` will be used to sign.
